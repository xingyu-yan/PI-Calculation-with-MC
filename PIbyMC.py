This program is for PI estimation with Monte Carlo simulation

General Idea: we will simulate a square with a circle inscribing it.
The square area = a^2, and the circle area = (pi*x^2)/4. 
Thus the ratio of circle to square is equal to pi/4. 
Therefore, if we can get the ratio, and multiply it by 4, we will have the value of pi.
To get the ratio, certain number of points will be randomly placed inside the geometric object
and see where each point lands. 
As the number of random placements increases, we'll get closer and closer to the ratio.
